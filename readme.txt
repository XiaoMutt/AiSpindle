/************************************AiSpindle**********************************/
AiSpindle is a Java package to auto detect spindle (microtubule and DNA contours).
This is an fully-functional, proof-of-concept alpha version, though many improvement are needed
The ultimate goal is to implement machine learning into the AiSpindle package.

XLineScan: a Java app to find pole-to-pole axis of spindles from microscopy images
AiSpindle: the spindle auto-detection package
AiSpindleTest: a test program to see how AiSpindle handle a microscopy image (displaying the features identified).
